                            <br><br>
                            
                            Ameera Coperation was first established in May 1969 and was named Koperasi Gotong Royong which at that time only managed the Business Unit & Savings and Loans. By mutual agreement between Teachers, Employees and Parents, in 1972 Ameera Coperation expanded its business by providing basic daily necessities to meet the needs of parents & students of Ameera International School in general as well as Teachers and Employees of Ameera Foundation in particular.</p><br>
