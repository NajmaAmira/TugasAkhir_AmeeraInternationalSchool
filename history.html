                   <h4>History of the Foundation</h4><br>
                   <p>Ameera Foundation was founded on April 7, 1952 by 14 community leaders and leaders in Semarang, under the name Ameera Foundation. One of the originators of the idea of establishing this foundation was dr. Syamsuddin, the Minister of Social Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia at that time, who was supported by Sjamsuridjal, who at that time was the Mayor of Semarang. While the names of the founders of the foundation in full are: Soedirdjo, Tan In Hok, Gazali Syahlan, H. Sjuaib Sastradiwirja, Abdullah Salim, Rais Chamis, Ganda, Kartapradja, Sardjono, H. Sulaiman Rasjid, Faray Martak, Jacub Rasjid, Hasan Argubie dan Hariri Hady. <br><br>
                    The Ameera Foundation acquired a piece of land located in the Semarang area which at that time was a satellite area of Central Java. It was on that land that in 1953 the construction of a large school began to be carried out and it was completed in 1958. <br><br>
                    In 1961 Mahmoud Syaltout, then Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Cairo, visited the country as a state guest and made a stopover at the Ameera foundation. His arrival was welcomed by his friend Buya Prof. Dr. Hamka, Imam of the Great Mosque of Kebayoran, who two years earlier was awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa (Ustadziyah Fakhriyah) by Al Azhar University Cairo. <br><br>
                    Along with the times and the needs of the people, activities at the Ameera Foundation continue to grow and develop. Initially, the activity was only attended by the surrounding community, including beca pedalers and building coolies. Now students come from various walks of life, not only those who live in the elite area of Semarang, even from outside areas such as Tangerang, Bekasi, Depok, Bogor and others. <br><br>
                    The lively coaching activities at the Ameera foundation cannot be separated from the role of Buya Prof. Dr. Hamka as a leader at the Ameera foundation. The figure of Buya, whose lectures always bring coolness with a polite choice of sentences, has bound the attention of the ummah in various corners, especially through the Lecture event broadcast by RRI. In addition to fostering various foundation activities, courses, Buya Prof. Dr. Hamka also encourages the growth and development of International schools. These school activities are increasingly gaining a place in the hearts of the community and adding to the name of Ameera International School in the midst of ummat, not only in Semarang and its surroundings but also to various regions in the country.  <br><br>
                    Buya Prof. Dr. Hamka, who happens to live on Jl. Raden Patah III, Semarang, located adjacent to the Great Mosque of Al Azhar, has led the daily implementation of the school since it was first used in 1958. The interpretation study, which is a lecture material every day at the Ameera foundation and then published serially in Gema magazine since 1962, was finally published under the name Tafsir Ameera which has received a good response from the public until now. <br><br>
                    There are currently more than 25 groups of activities that daily enliven religious life in the Ameera foundation complex, with various forms and patterns of activities, such as courses, public lectures, discussions, health services, corpse services, Hajj and Umrah travel guidance, martial arts, formal education – from kindergarten to college – to banking services and travel bureaus.</p>
